Challenge Description
=====================

You have a set of rows with names of famous writers encoded inside. 
Each row is divided into 2 parts by pipe char (|). 
The first part has a writer's name. 
The second part is a "key" to generate a name.

Your goal is to go through each number in the key (numbers are separated by space)
 left-to-right. Each number represents a position in the 1st part of a row. 
 This way you collect a writer's name which you have to output.

## Input sample

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Input example is the following
```
